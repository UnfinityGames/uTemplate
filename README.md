# uTemplate Template Repository
Welcome to the Template Repository for uTemplate!  Depending on what you're here to do, there's two sections to get you started: Downloading Templates and Submitting Templates.  First up, Downloading Templates.

## Downloading Templates
uTemplate has a built-in download function.  It'll not only show you what's available and allow you to download it, it'll also handle importing them into the correct directories.

It's generally easier to let the downloader do the heavy lifting for you, but in case you want to do things manually, you can either download or fork-and-pull this repository.  Note: when placing template files in your project manually, make sure to place them in the user-specified Template directory.  (You can check and change this in in the uTemplate Preferences)

## Submitting Templates
Anyone can submit new templates to this repository.  Instructions on how to do so are coming soon!

## License
This repository is designed for use in conjunction with uTemplate.  As such, this repository is considered an extension of uTemplate, and is covered under the same license (i.e. the [Unity Asset Store EULA](https://unity3d.com/legal/as_terms)).
